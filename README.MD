## Program description

Interactive Arithmetic Learning App
This project aims to create an interactive learning application focused on arithmetic operations. Users will engage in
solving generated mathematical expressions, with the application offering various levels of difficulty. Additionally,
the app will track user progress, save results, and provide feedback to enhance the learning experience. Join us in
building a tool that fosters quick and efficient arithmetic learning.

Have fun!
